My own pipeline

This pipeline was established to analyze our in-house dataset, but it can also be applied to any other RNA-seq data analysis.
A preprint of this pipeline has been available in bioRxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.15.562329v1.
This pipeline is also under review by Aging research.
Please feel free to use this pipeline and cite the reference papers.
